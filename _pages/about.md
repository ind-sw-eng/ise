ITU Second year project: Software Development in Large Teams + ITU Master's students Scrum Master course

We have been running this course since 2017. It requires a close collaboration with the Industry. 

Students collaborate with industrial partners on projects relevant to their needs. They experience what it's like to work on a real project in a setting as realistic as possible, applying all the software engineering skills they've learned in their earlier courses and learning new technologies.

Student teams learn to apply Scrum in practice by performing short iterations in their projects. Each group of 8â€“9 students will be supported by: a product owner from the industrial partner, a scrum master enrolled in a master-level elective course, and an experienced Agile coach from the industry for the project's duration. 

The Industrial Partners are very enthusiastic and come back with new projects from year to year. Contact vinc@itu.dk or pate@itu.dk if you have questions.
