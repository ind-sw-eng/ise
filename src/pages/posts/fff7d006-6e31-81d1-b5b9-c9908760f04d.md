# How to get started with grpc 


### Pre requirements:




- [**Go**](https://golang.org/), any one of the **two latest major** [releases of Go](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html).

For installation instructions, see Go’s [Getting Started](https://golang.org/doc/install) guide


.


After which you could install it globally using  `go install` but most of the time this does not work as such i recommend you install it in the project you are working on. 





The command for installing GRPC globally is 


```bash
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest

export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"

```

That’s it you now have grpc installed but you are not done yet. How do you then setup the grpc ? 





Well below i will show you how by showing you an example project setup:





Setup your project

1. **Create a directory for your project:**

Open your terminal and run:


```text
mkdir my-go-project
cd my-go-project

```

2. **Create a** **`main.go`** **file:**

Inside your project directory, create a `main.go` file:


```text
touch main.go

```


Open `main.go` in your preferred text editor and add some basic Go code:


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/golang/protobuf/proto"
)

func main() {

	fmt.Printf("example")
}
```

3. **Initialize a new Go module:**

Run the following command to initialize a new Go module:


```text
go mod init my-go-project

```


This will create a `go.mod` file in your project directory.

4. **Install** **`protoc`** **with Go modules:**

To use `protoc` in your Go project, you need to install `protoc` and the Go plugins for Protobuf. Follow these steps:

- **Install Protocol Buffers Compiler (****`protoc`****):**
- On macOS, you can install it using Homebrew:

```text
brew install protobuf

```

- On Ubuntu, you can install it using `apt`:

```text
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y protobuf-compiler

```

- On Windows, you can download the pre-compiled binaries from the [official Protocol Buffers releases page](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) and add the `protoc` binary to your PATH.
- **Install Go plugins for Protobuf:**

Add the required Go plugins to your `go.mod` file by running:


```text
go get google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
```


These commands will add the necessary dependencies to your `go.mod` file.

5. **Verify the installation:**

You can verify the installation by checking the versions of `protoc` and the installed Go plugins:


```text
protoc --version
protoc-gen-go --version
protoc-gen-go-grpc --version

```


And that's it! You now have a Go project set up with `protoc` and the necessary Go plugins for Protobuf. You can start defining your `.proto` files and generating Go code from them.
