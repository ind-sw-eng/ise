- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous compliance monitoring across systems
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated risk scoring and prioritization
- **Compliance Reporting**: Comprehensive audit trails and reports

## Technical Architecture

The system was developed using:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for text analysis
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for document understanding
- Machine Learning models for pattern recognition
- RESTful API architecture
- Cloud-native deployment with Docker and Kubernetes

## Key Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Handles compliance documents in multiple languages
- **Contextual Analysis**: Understands legal context and nuances
- **Integration Ready**: APIs for seamless integration with existing systems
- **Dashboard Interface**: Intuitive web dashboard for compliance teams
