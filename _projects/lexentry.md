## Project Overview

Lexentry partnered with ISE students to create a cutting-edge GenAI-powered system for detecting GDPR violations across internal corporate channels. This innovative solution leverages artificial intelligence to identify potential privacy & compliance issues.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Automated Detection**: AI-powered identification of GDPR violations
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous compliance monitoring across configurable systems: Exchange mail, Slack, Google Workspace
3. **GDPR Violation Assessment**: Capability to detect Article 9 GDPR violations
4. **Flexible Compliance Reporting**: Ability to configure enabling and disabling of specific GDPR articles
5. **NFRs**: Security, Scalability and Extensibility

 
## Technical Architecture

The system was developed using:
1. Large Language Models (LLMs) for text analysis
2. C# Backend with .NET packages
3. API.NET and API SDKs
4. Inspection and detection engine written in Python with Dagster data orchestration
5. Front end: TypeScript, Next.js, tailwind, and pnpm


## Impact

The system has significantly reduced manual compliance review time while increasing accuracy in identifying potential GDPR violations, helping organizations maintain robust data protection standards.
