## Technical Architecture

The application was built using:
1. React for the frontend interface
2. Node.js backend with Express
3. Javascript used for backend and frontend
4. Chart.js for customizable chart components
5. MariaDB as database on Cloudways (hosting provider)
6. Docker to ensure an identical development environment on our PCs
