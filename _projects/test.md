Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    layout: page
    title: project

Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated,  for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.



The code is simple.



```html

```
